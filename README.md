This repository is basically created to store all the codes written in python during the practice sessions.
Each program shows different uses of commands in the language.
These are easy codes which you might have already experimented or had a look on from another programmer.
Feel free to suggest some changes in the code to make it short and also leave a comment if you find any mistake(s) in the code
Happy coding :)
